## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
Create `Backend/.env` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/heart-connect
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
PORT=4001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://your-domain.com
SOCKET_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://your-domain.com
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Backend dependencies (already installed)
cd Backend
npm install

# Frontend dependencies (already installed)
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Application

#### Option A: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd Backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

#### Option B: Use Startup Scripts
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
.\start-servers.ps1

# Windows Command Prompt
start-servers.bat
```

### 4. Test Real-Time Features

#### Single Device Testing:
1. Open http://localhost:5173/home
2. Post a feeling
3. Open another browser tab/window
4. Post another feeling
5. Verify both appear in both windows
6. Test likes and comments

#### Multi-Device Testing:
1. Start the servers
2. Open the app on different devices (phone, tablet, computer)
3. Use the same network or deploy to a server
4. Test real-time interactions across devices

## 🔧 Key Features

### Real-Time Posting
- When User A posts a feeling, it appears instantly for User B
- No page refresh needed
- Database persistence ensures data survives server restarts

### Live Like System
- Click like on any post
- All users see the like count update instantly
- Like status persists across sessions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to load feelings"**
   - Check if backend server is running on port 4001
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Real-time not working**
   - Ensure socket connection is established
   - Check for CORS issues
   - Verify both servers are running

3. **Database connection issues**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running
   - Check MONGODB_URI in .env file
   - Verify database permissions

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Look for socket connection messages

## 📱 Mobile Testing

For testing on mobile devices:
1. Find your computer's IP address
2. Update the API URL in `client/src/utils/api.js` and `client/src/utils/socket.js`
3. Or use a service like ngrok to expose your local server

## 🚀 Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
2. Deploy backend to services like Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean
3. Deploy frontend to Netlify, Vercel, or similar
4. Update environment variables for production URLs

## 📊 Performance Notes

- Socket connections are optimized for multiple users
- Database queries are indexed for performance
- Real-time updates are batched to prevent spam
- Error handling prevents crashes from network issues

## 🎯 Next Steps

Consider adding:
- User profiles and avatars
- Friend system
- Post categories/tags
- Image uploads
- Push notifications
